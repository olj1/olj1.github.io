<!-- Let's create a simple number guessing game. The computer will pick a random number between 1 and 100 and you will have to guess that number. -->

<!-- Requirements
The user should be able to guess a number until they guess the right number.
The user should be able to input a number and click a button to submit the number.
The webpage should inform the user to guess a higher number, guess a lower number, or tell the user they guessed the correct number.
The webpage should list all guessed numbers the user guessed during the session.
Your number guessing game will consist of an HTML file, CSS file, and a Javascript file. -->
